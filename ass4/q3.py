# QUESTION
# ==================================================================================
# You are on vacation for N days at a resort that has three possible activities.
# For each day, for each activity, youâ€™ve determined how much enjoyment you
# will get out of that activity. However, you are not allowed to do the same
# activity two days in a row. What is the maximum total enjoyment possible?
# ==================================================================================
