# advanced_algorithms_assignments
The assignments we were given for advanced algorithms built upon concepts of data structures and algorithms. 

They really helped me gain a strong foothold on solving problems and visualising solutions before actually sitting down to code. 

Only the pseudo-code for  the solutions were required to be submitted, but I've also included my python scripts as the proof-of-concept for each solution.
